# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component is responsible for enabling AWS Shield Advanced Protection for the following resources:

  - Application Load Balancers (ALBs)
  - CloudFront Distributions
  - Elastic IPs
  - Route53 Hosted Zones

  This component assumes that resources it is configured to protect are not already protected by other components that
  have their `xxx_aws_shield_protection_enabled` variable set to `true`.

  This component also requires that the account where the component is being provisioned to has been
  [subscribed to AWS Shield Advanced](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/enable-ddos-prem.html).
usage: |-
  **Stack Level**: Global or Regional

  The following snippet shows how to use all of this component's features in a stack configuration:

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      aws-shield:
        settings:
          spacelift:
            workspace_enabled: true
        vars:
          enabled: true
          route53_zone_names:
            - test.ue1.example.net
          alb_names:
            - k8s-common-2c5f23ff99
          cloudfront_distribution_ids:
            - EDFDVBD632BHDS5
          eips:
            - 3.214.128.240
            - 35.172.208.150
            - 35.171.70.50
  ```

  A typical global configuration will only include the `route53_zone_names` and `cloudfront_distribution_ids` variables,
  as global Route53 Hosted Zones may exist in that account, and because CloudFront is a global AWS service.

  A global stack configuration will not have a VPC, and hence `alb_names` and `eips` should not be defined:

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      aws-shield:
        settings:
          spacelift:
            workspace_enabled: true
        vars:
          enabled: true
          route53_zone_names:
            - test.example.net
          cloudfront_distribution_ids:
            - EDFDVBD632BHDS5
  ```

  Regional stack configurations will typically make use of all resources except for `cloudfront_distribution_ids`:

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      aws-shield:
        settings:
          spacelift:
            workspace_enabled: true
        vars:
          route53_zone_names:
            - test.ue1.example.net
          alb_names:
            - k8s-common-2c5f23ff99
          eips:
            - 3.214.128.240
            - 35.172.208.150
            - 35.171.70.50
  ```

  Stack configurations which rely on components with a `xxx_aws_shield_protection_enabled` variable should set that
  variable to `true` and leave the corresponding variable for this component as empty, relying on that component's AWS
  Shield Advanced functionality instead. This leads to more simplified inter-component dependencies and minimizes the need
  for maintaining the provisioning order during a cold-start.
